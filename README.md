# A Completely Ethical Mod

Finally, a way to play Minecraft that your therapist might approve of. Maybe. In an effort to prevent any sort of ethical dilemmas, I've removed most ways a player can directly or indirectly damage mobs. There are still ways to beat the game, albeit morally gray.

Additionally, the ability to manually spawn Snow Golems in the Nether has been disabled, as their immediate demise in the heat would be considered unethical.

## Prevented Damage Types:

* **Fire Damage (On Fire, In Fire, Campfire, Lava, Unattributed Fireball):** Prevents the player from indirectly burning mobs by leading them into fire, lava, or near campfires, as well as stopping damage from fireballs that could have been ignited by the player.
* **Lightning Bolt:** Stops the player from using lightning rods to intentionally direct lightning strikes at mobs.
* **Drowning:** Prevents the player from trapping mobs underwater to cause them to drown.
* **Fall Damage:** Stops the player from causing mobs to fall from heights, either by pushing them or creating precarious situations.
* **Suffocation in Walls (In Wall):** Prevents the player from intentionally trapping mobs in walls where they would suffocate.
* **Damage from Spiky Plants (Cactus, Sweet Berry Bush, Stalagmite):** Stops the player from luring or pushing mobs into damaging flora and geological formations.
* **Fireworks:** Prevents the player from using fireworks to damage mobs with explosions.
* **Falling Objects (Falling Block, Falling Anvil, Falling Stalactite):** Stops the player from dropping blocks like anvils or stalactites onto mobs.
* **Explosions (Explosion, Player Explosion, Sonic Boom):** Prevents the player from triggering explosions, whether from creepers they might manipulate or TNT they ignite. The Sonic Boom from the Warden, while less direct, is also likely being prevented due to potential player manipulation of the Warden's behavior.
* **Freezing:** Stops the player from using mechanics or items that inflict freezing damage on mobs.
